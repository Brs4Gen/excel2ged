Release Notes for Excel2GED_v3.0

Excel2GED is an Excel spreadsheet with a macro for converting genealogy data into a GEDCOM-formatted text file with a '.ged' file extension. A GEDCOM file is generated by clicking the VBA-coded macro buttons 'Export' or 'Export to GEDCOM' after creating & selecting a recipient folder. That file can then be imported into a genealogy program, with family relationships already defined, BMD data included, and source notes attached.

1.0 - ILoveCoding     
"Current bug shows all children under last spouse. If you find this to be the case, for now, enter only one partner and fix the problem in your genealogy software. For a man with multiple wives having children with each, enter the first wife as attached to the husband and the second as being initially single until you get into your genealogy program then attach them to the husband. You can also have multiple instances of the same man or woman and merge them later on with the program where you import the gedcom. My apologies for the inconvenience."
            
2.0 - HeatPumpGuy     
* Multiple spouses and their children are correctly represented. A person with more than one spouse is given multiple adjacent rows, one per spouse.
* Same-sex marriages are legal. Some genealogy programs support this and some do not, but the exported GEDCOM can have two spouses of the same sex.
* Major bug:  the worksheet is password protected by default, password "x2g", but fails to create family relationships correctly until password protection is inactivated.
* Minor bug: even with password protection turned off, it sometimes fails to update family relationships correctly.
            
2.1 - HeatPumpGuy
