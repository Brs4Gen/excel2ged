Instructions for Getting Started

Download and save files in default folder location C:\Excel2GED. 
Otherwise, modify the link to photos for relevant individuals in the 'Photo File Path' cells (column O) of the 'Individuals' tab of the .xlsm workbook to agree with your folder of choice. 

Open the .xlsm workbook. 

As needed, modify the output destination in cell 'G1' for a to-be-generated GEDCOM file. The destination folder must already exist before exporting the .ged file. 

Click the 'Export' or 'Export to GEDCOM' button to create a .ged file with the data provided in the 'Individuals' tab/worksheet. 

Import the GEDCOM data in the newly created .ged file into a new database for your genealogy program of choice. Note any messages related to the import as provided by your program. Depending on which program you use, the photo files may need to be identified as such (vs., e.g., "Document") within the program before the image will appear with the individual. Inspect the database with the newly imported individuals and families from the .ged file. 

Select and delete the provided information in all data cells (columns A through P) of the 'Individuals' tab, starting at spreadsheet row 4. (The same data is saved in the 'SampleFams1' tab if you wish to use it again later.)

Enter your own data (consider using the 'ListPrep' worksheet), following instructions provided in the 'Help' tab. Clicking "Operation Instructions" also takes you to that worksheet. Additional tips are found in column W in the upper right area of the 'Individuals' tab.
