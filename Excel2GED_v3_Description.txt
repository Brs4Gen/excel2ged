"
Excel2GED is an Excel spreadsheet with a macro for converting genealogy data into a GEDCOM-formatted text file with a '.ged' file extension. A GEDCOM file is generated by clicking the VBA-coded macro buttons 'Export' or 'Export to GEDCOM' after creating & selecting a recipient folder. That file can then be imported into a genealogy program, with family relationships already defined, BMD data included, and source notes attached. 
 
Output has been validated to conform to GEDCOM 5.5.1 by software from https://chronoplexsoftware.com/gedcomvalidator and 
ShowMeGEDCOM from http://www.familienbande-genealogie.de.
 
Some improved features in version 3: 
Multiple marriages and adopted children are handled correctly.
Same-sex marriages/partnerships and children are accommodated. 
View the 'ReleaseNotes' worksheet for additional details. 

If needed, the spreadsheet protection password is 'x2g'.

Excel2GED 1.0 was first commissioned in 2008 by Paul D. Pruitt. 
Others have volunteered development effort since then."
